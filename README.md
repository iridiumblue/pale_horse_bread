This recipe was created out of necessity during the pandemic.  I'm not much of a baker, and I found bread-making to be a very glitchy and uncertain process.  Sometimes it would come out dense as concrete or wouldn't rise at all.   Other times it would be soft and mushy.   Occasionally it would come out OK but then I couldn't duplicate the feat.

I tried all sorts of things like using a water pan, trying to make a Dutch Oven, different temperatures and so on.   Nothing worked.

Then I stumbled upon this technique when I fell asleep while making bread.   After an 8 hour dozing, I figured the bread was ruined.   I didn't want to waste precious dough, though, so I went ahead on the off-chance the result wasn't a total waste.

To my amazement it came out perfectly.    Repeated trials revealed it was no fluke, it comes out awesome every time.  I considered it my civic duty to write it up and share it with a world locked down in quarantine.

# Pale Horse Sourdough Bread recipe.

* Sourdough starter from fridge  130 grams               (2/3 cup by volume)
* Spring water  							   345 grams
* Flour  											 460 grams               (3 1/4 cups by volume)

* Salt   2 1/2 teaspoons

If you have a kitchen scale, weighing ingredients by grams is the way to go.  If not, use the volume (cup) measurements - but careful with the flour.   Flour can vary greatly in density depending how packed it is, to correct for this make sure it's fluffed up good with a fork when measuring.

Warm the starter up by placing a jar of it in a bowl of tap water at 100 or so degrees for 20 minutes.  (No thermometer?  Go by touch, 100 degree water feels tepid - neither hot nor cold when you put a finger in it.)

The starter will expand and start to become foamy.  I used a black marker here to show the level rise from 20 minutes of warming :

Make sure the starter is ready to use by doing the Float Test.   Pour a spoonful into the water,if it floats, you're ready to make bread!  If not - it's back to the drawing board with your starter.  (Maybe ask a friend for advice.)

Put starter in very large bowl.   Add spring water or filtered water. (Chlorinated tap water can kill the yeast.)  Mix thoroughly with whisk.  Take crappy photo.

Slowly add flour, mixing as you go.   Mix with spoon at first, toward the end use bare hand.   (Wet your hand first w/ cold water to minimize sticking.)  Don't add the salt, we won't do that til much later.

The final result should be just goopy enough that it can be poured, very slowly like honey.    If yours doesn't do that, adjust with more water or more flour.

<img width=400 src="https://github.com/iridiumblue/pale_horse_bread/blob/master/gif/p11.gif" alt="p11" style="zoom:50%;" />

Cover with a towel and let sit on counter for an hour.   

<img width=400 src="https://github.com/iridiumblue/pale_horse_bread/blob/master/gif/p1.gif" alt="p1" style="zoom:50%;" />



Plunge a spoon or hand into the dough, and give it a good upward stretch.  (Two for extra credit.)



<img width=400 src="https://github.com/iridiumblue/pale_horse_bread/blob/master/gif/p21.gif" alt="p21" style="zoom:50%;" />



Wait another hour, and repeat the stretch.

OK!  Nothing for you to do as the yeast comes on the job for an 8 hour shift.  Just leave on counter with towel cover.

8 hours later,the dough should be showing large bubbles just under the surface.   (If it isn't, try giving it some more time.)

<img width=400 src="https://github.com/iridiumblue/pale_horse_bread/blob/master/gif/p22.gif" alt="p22" style="zoom:50%;" />

Scatter 1 tablespoon of salt on top and work in very thoroughly with bare hands.  Dough will become 'punched down' (lose its volume from the rise.)

<img width=400 src="https://github.com/iridiumblue/pale_horse_bread/blob/master/gif/p24.gif" alt="p24" style="zoom:50%;" />



Cover again with towel and wait 1-2 hours.  You should notice bubbles starting to reappear.

Time to bake!   Grab a bread-pan.   Preheat oven to 500.   Line bread-pan with parchment paper.   (You can use tinfoil instead if necessary.)  Cut two pieces of parchment to fit like so :

<img width=400 src="https://github.com/iridiumblue/pale_horse_bread/blob/master/gif/pxx.gif" alt="pxx" style="zoom:50%;" />



Pour all the dough in.   It'll only fill 1/3-1/2 way, that's OK.   It's about to spring up like crazy.

<img width=400 src="https://github.com/iridiumblue/pale_horse_bread/blob/master/gif/p27.gif" alt="p27" style="zoom:50%;" />

Use a baking sheet as a cover for the breadpan.  Put covered breadpan in oven for 10 minutes.  Remove cover - you'll see the dough has risen.   

<img width=400 src="https://github.com/iridiumblue/pale_horse_bread/blob/master/gif/p28.gif" alt="p28" style="zoom:50%;" />

Bake another 20 minutes with cover off.   Take breadpan out of oven, remove loaf.  Lift off the parchment paper. 



<img width=400 src="https://github.com/iridiumblue/pale_horse_bread/blob/master/gif/p30.gif" alt="p30" style="zoom:50%;" />

Lower oven temperature to 450 degrees.   Place loaf directly on rack.  

<img width=400 src="https://github.com/iridiumblue/pale_horse_bread/blob/master/gif/p31.gif" alt="p31" style="zoom:50%;" />

The crust will start to darken.    Keep checking back until you've got a rich, deep brown color.  About 15-25 minutes.

If you have a cooling rack, place bread on that.   Otherwise just place the loaf atop a bowl or something so that air can get to the bottom.  (Otherwise, the bottom can turn out soggy.)

The crust will feel solid as concrete when the bread first comes out.  Not to worry, it'll soften up as the bread cools.  Resist the urge to hack open your bread right away - it's not really done cooking until it cools down.



<img width=400 src="https://github.com/iridiumblue/pale_horse_bread/blob/master/gif/p32.gif" alt="p32" style="zoom:50%;" />

After a couple of hours, when you can comfortably handle the bread in your hands, it's ready to eat!

To store - it is best to keep your bread on the counter in a brown paper bag.     Don't store it in the fridge.   

If the crust is too stiff for your liking, store the loaf a few hours in a ziplock bag to soften it up.   (The next time you make bread, wrap it in a damp towel the first 30 minutes of cooling for a softer crust.)



**Science info for nerds**

This recipe is different than most recipes in a few ways.   The awesome power of Science has been invoked to remove steps and improve quality.  (At least, this is why I think it works so well.)

**No kneading.**    In many recipes, you have to knead the dough by folding and pressing it over and over.   What this does is press together protein molecules in order to form gluten, which is the stuff that gives bread its structure and elasticity.   

In this recipe, the dough is wetter than usual, and we're letting it ferment a long time at room temperature.    The extra water allows the protein molecules to move around more easily and link up naturally.   The long, warm fermentation creates expanding bubbles which stretch the dough for us.   The yeast does the kneading.

**No Shaping**

Other recipes require you to hand-shape your dough into a ball or loaf just before baking.  The dough is cut, shaped, and scored in order to control the shape it grows into.

Here, the dough is too wet for that.  So we need a bread-pan to provide shape - but the wetness confers a big benefit : the heat is distributed more evenly.    This creates a very vigorous and even "oven spring" in the first 10 minutes or so, compared with the slower and less even rise of a drier dough. 

**Wait for the salt**

Other recipes add salt right away with the flour and water, or an hour or so into fermentation.  But salt slows fermentation down.   So we give the dough a long, warm fermentation period of 10 hours first.   

Because our dough is wetter, we are still able to mix the salt in after all that time.   In addition, by pressing the salt in with our hands, we are 'punching down' the dough just prior to baking, which aids in gluten formation.    So we've combined two steps into one.
